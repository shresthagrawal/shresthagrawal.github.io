In this research we have tried to create a real time system that can predict the behavior and spread of known as well as unknown contagious diseases and finally give policy suggestion on what, where, and how much of vaccination, medication, and isolation is required to stop the outbreak of the disease. This system also tries to come up with an innovative mitigating solution Cyber Quarantine using GPS data points. The system works on the plank of SIR model and tries to use the latest systems and technology to improve the existing SIR Model. It is also linked with a huge Data Base of IDSP (Indian Disease Surveillance Program) and finally the whole system is formulated in form of an Android App so that it can reach the masses and can be easily accessible.
