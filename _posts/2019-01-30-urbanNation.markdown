_A programmer going to art museum does not fit ? Right ?_

I thought the same when my Deustch Sprache Schule(German Language Classes) decided to go to the URBAN NATION museum on wall art after the mid break of the class. Though I sometimes make portraits as a hobby I have never been to an _actual art museum_. The Indian museum filled ancestral clothes, weapons, and broken objects has never amused me enough rather had created an prejudice for the word museum as ‘**ancient**’ and ‘**langweilich**’.

I entered this modern museum art.  These are some of the images of the museum:

I loved it !! The more I saw I an art the better I started to understand the emotion and the motivation of the artist and the more I understood the more I wanted to know !! Every angle from which you see these Images you see a different story narrated by itself.

This one was my fav image!

If u see every stroke, its vague and dirty but the complete picture looks perfect. The bird gives me the smell of freedom, and it even portrays that if u fly free and high what u have inside is nothing but just ur thoughts and values!
